# MERN-Todo-App

A full-stack Todo application built with the MERN stack and styled with Tailwind CSS. This project serves as a robust template for building modern web applications with a clear separation between the backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) and the frontend (React with Vite).

# Features

* RESTful API:
Built using Node.js and Express to handle CRUD operations for todo items.

* Data Persistence:
Utilizes MongoDB with Mongoose for efficient data modeling and storage.

* Modern Frontend:
A fast and responsive user interface built with React and Vite.

* Tailwind CSS:
Provides utility-first CSS classes for rapid styling and responsive design.

# Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14+ recommended)
* MongoDB (local or remote instance)
* Git (for version control)

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MERN-Todo-App.git
cd MERN-Todo-App
